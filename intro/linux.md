# Linux - It's Fun We Promise

This page is intended to provide a collection of resources for beginning linux
user. Navigating linux, the command line or `git` have all been extensively
written about by much smarter and more literate people. As such this page will
mainly be links out to other resource, with some rough guidelines on reading order.

## General Linux

**[Unix for the Beginning Mage]:** A whimsical approach to learning Linux

[Unix for the Beginning Mage]: https://lab46.g7n.org/_media/haas/ufbm.pdf

## Bash

**[GNU Manuel](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html):**
Everything you wanted to know and more

## Git

**[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2):** Despite the name this is a very
accessible book, that does dive deep in later chapters. We recommend starting
with the following chapters:

    - [Git Basics]: Quick, but through introduction to using git
    - [Git Branching]: Solid intro into what branches are and how to use them

[Git Basics]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository
[Git Branching]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell

**[Learn Git Branching]:** An interactive simulator of a git with easy to follow
tutorials and a great visual representation of what's going on.

The following is a list of *some* graphical interfaces to git. We do recommend
leaning the command line interface, but these can provide a complementary tool
when navigating git.
