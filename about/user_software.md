## Available Software

Arjuna uses `modules` to provide access to some common software packages and tools.
For a complete list of the currently available software run: `module avail`

To load a module named `module_name` run: `module load module_name`

For more information, see [Lmod's documentation](https://lmod.readthedocs.io).

## Requesting Additional Software

In general, we recommend users install additional software to their home directory
and independently manage/maintain it. As files placed in a user's home directory
are immediately available on the compute nodes via the [RAID storage].

[RAID storage]: {% link about/hardware.md %}#raid-storage

Before installing software, please refer to the software already installed by
other users on the cluster.
