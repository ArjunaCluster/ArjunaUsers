## Available Software

Arjuna uses `modules` to provide access to some common software packages and tools.
For a complete list of the currently available software run: `module avail`

A particular module can then be loaded via: `module load module_name`.

For more information see the [Lmod's documentation](https://lmod.readthedocs.io).

## Requesting Additional Software

In general, we recommend users install additional software to their home directory
and independently manage / maintain it. The `/home` directory is stored on the
[RAID storage] and thus is immediately available on all Compute Nodes.

[RAID storage]: {% link about/hardware.md %}#raid-storage

Before installing software, please refer to the software already installed by
other users on the cluster.
