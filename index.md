# Welcome!

Arjuna is a multi-departmental CPU and GPU computing cluster. Here you can find
documentation about what Arjuna is and how to use it.

## Support

If you encounter an issue using Arjuna, please [open an issue] and let us know.
We will do our best to get it sorted out.

## Maintenance

Arjuna will be taken offline for periodic updates, maintenance, and upgrades. We
will provide at least two week's notice via the list-serve email and via the
login message on Arjuna.

- Summary of Planned Activities
- Expected Duration
- Mitigation steps (if any) users may need to take

We intend to keep Arjuna up for as much time as possible. However, planned
periodic downtime for maintenance will likely improve total uptime and user
experience by catching and fixing issues before they become disruptive.
