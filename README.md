# User Guide for Arjuna #

The files in this folder will cover the following items

1) Arjuna Usage Best Practices Guidelines and Usage Policy
2) Common Tasks and how to do them
3) Where to find more information (ie. [https://slurm.schedmd.com/])

We will *not* duplicate documentation that can be found elsewhere
(ie. slurm commands). It will provide examples and tutorial on how to use those
commands.
